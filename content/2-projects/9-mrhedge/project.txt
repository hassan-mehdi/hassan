Text: Mr. Hedge was a concept design for a microsite, An existing client wanted to raise awareness of Hedge Funds to the general public about misconceptions within Hedge Funds. The client wanted to take a casual, creative and engaging approach and they had already decided upon a comic book theme and the mascot Mr. Hedge. I was tasked with designing the site as well as take the flat colour illustrations for a third party and ad shadows, highlights and backgrounds to create rich banners. As well as design the UI itself.
