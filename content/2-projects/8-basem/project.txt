Text: With closer ties to medicine science than sport science, The British Association of Sport & Exercise Medicine wanted to convey the idea of assurance, liveliness and accessibility. Taking the Union flag as inspiration the websites primary colour palette is red white and blue.

As the designer on the project, I also wanted to give BASEM plenty of space to feature content so there are multi-panel banners on the homepage, animated section homepages and cms editable buttons/calls to action.
