Text: The Institute of Masters of Wine is an internationally renowned wine master education/membership organisation. A highly prestigious organisation The IMW's website needed to reflect the prestige whilst still being a functional online service.

I decided to use strong flat colours coupled with a simple san-serif and aspiration imagery to create an elegant and versatile site.
