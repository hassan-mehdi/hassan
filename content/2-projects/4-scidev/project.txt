Text: SCIDEV.NET is an international charity whose aim is to spread science across the developing world, with close to 250,000 page hits a month and users base located all over the world, with no common language, inconsistent internet connections and the possiblity of antiquated devices.

In this project I was given the responsibility of the front-end developement, markup, styling and js had to be as lean as possible whilst still accomplishing the designer's full vision. The site also had to be built right to left for Arabic speaking countries. This site implements a stripped down low-bandwidth version which can be accessed on mobile, the low bandwidth version is extremely light using system fonts and vanilla js only when necessary.
