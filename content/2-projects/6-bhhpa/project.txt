Text: The British Holidays & Home Parks Association (BHHPA) is a fast growing membership organisation that produces a lot of documentation, journals and other publications. Previously there had been a simple site with an unordered list of links to download documents. When appointed, we designed a fully searchable library system with login security, elastic search, favouriting options and also a pdf previewer.

As the designer in the project, I wanted to make something that reflected the large vistas and inspiring views the organisation monitors over. As a result each page has a banner of the British Landscape.
